    <p> This meatloaf-cheeseburger hybrid is just as comforting as the kind mom used to make, but with a little more personality (hello, melty nuggets of cheddar!).</p>

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>

            <li>1/4 cup plain breadcrumbs ($0.06)</li>
            <li>1 tsp smoked paprika ($0.10)</li>

            <li>3/4 tsp salt ($0.03)</li>
            <li>1 large egg ($0.27)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup minced onion ($0.16)</li>
            <li>4 oz. sharp cheddar ($0.85)</li>

        <ul>
            <li>Step 1
                Preheat the oven to 350ºF. In a small bowl stir together the breadcrumbs, smoked paprika, garlic powder, and salt. In a separate small bowl, lightly whisk the egg.</li>
            <li>Step 2
                Finely mince the onion. Roughly chop the cheddar cheese so that it is in pieces about the same size as a small bean.</li>    
            <li>Step 3
                Add the ground beef, seasoned breadcrumbs, whisked egg, minced onion, and chopped cheddar to a bowl. Use your hands to mix the ingredients together until incorporated.</li>
            <li>Step 4
                Place the meat mixture in a casserole dish or on a rimmed baking sheet and shape into a rectangle, approximately 7" long, 4" wide, and 1.5" thick.</li>
            <li>Step 5
                To make the glaze, stir together the ketchup, brown sugar, mustard, and Worcestershire sauce. Spread the glaze over the unbaked meatloaf.</li>
            <li>Step 6
                Bake the meatloaf in the preheated oven for 50-55 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 160ºF. Remove the meatloaf from the oven, let it sit for 5-10 minutes, then slice into eight pieces and serve.</li>
